## Cloud Architecture üèóÔ∏è
In our application we use Cloud Run, Cloud Storage, and Cloud SQL services to support our application to run. So, the frontend will consume the API from two servers; Backend and Machine Learning models. For the Backend, it will directly connect to Cloud SQL as a database. For the Machine Learning models, it will directly connect to Cloud Storage to store the analyzed images from the user and to Cloud SQL as a database. We put these services in asia-southeast2 region.

## Tools - Framework üîß
Our Cloud Computing project is created with:
* Express.js
* Flask
* Cloud SQL
* Cloud Run
* Cloud Storage

## The Steps 
1. Creating Login and Registration Using JSON Web Tokens
   - JSON Web Token Installation
   - Create and Verify Token
2. Creation of Backend Login and Registration Using Express.js
   - Express.js installation
   - Express Server Settings
   - Create an Endpoint to Register
   - Create an Endpoint to Login
3. Deployment to Google Cloud using Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage, and Cloud Run
   - Set up Cloud SQL:
     * Create a Cloud SQL instance in Google Cloud Console.
     * Configure database and users.
     * Save connection details for use in the app.
   - Set Up Cloud Storage:
     * Create a bucket in Google Cloud Storage.
     * Configure the bucket to store the files the application needs.
   - Deployment with Cloud Run:
     * Dockerizing the Application
     * Build and Push Images
     * Deploy to Cloud Run
